# The Infinite Dungeon ‚öîÔ∏è

Welcome to The Infinite Dungeon, a feature-rich, command-line rogue-like RPG. Dive into a procedurally generated world where every playthrough is unique. Battle a vast bestiary of monsters, solve clever puzzles, interact with NPCs, complete quests, manage your equipment, and seek legendary artifacts to conquer the dungeon's greatest challenges.

## üéÆ How to Play

Your goal is to become a legend by exploring the dungeon, growing stronger, and ultimately finding a legendary Winning Item. Acquiring such an artifact will summon a powerful guardian you must defeat to truly master the dungeon.

## Core Gameplay

### üß≠ Exploring
The dungeon is an endless series of randomly generated rooms. Each room can contain monsters, items, hazards, NPCs, or puzzles. Pay attention to the descriptions!

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat
When you encounter a monster, combat is turn-based. You can attack, use items, or attempt to run. Defeating monsters grants you Gold and Experience Points (XP).

### üîº Leveling Up
Gaining enough XP will increase your Level, raising your Max HP, Attack Power, and Critical Hit Chance, and fully restoring your health. You will also gain skill points to unlock new abilities.

### üß© Puzzles and Traps
Some rooms contain puzzles like riddles or mechanisms. Solving them can yield valuable rewards or open new paths. Beware of hidden traps that can damage you or poison you.

### üìú Quests
You'll find Quest Givers in special Inn rooms or wandering the dungeon. Completing their tasks provides significant rewards in Gold, XP, and unique items.

### ü§ù NPCs and Factions
Talk to characters you meet. Some are vendors who will buy and sell goods, while others may offer quests or useful information. Your actions can affect your reputation with factions like the Iron Dwarves and the Myconid Colony.

### üéí Equipment
Manage your inventory, equip better weapons, armor, shields, and cloaks to improve your attack and defense. Some items provide permanent stat boosts!

### üíæ Saving
You can save your progress at any time and load it from the main menu.

### üî® Crafting and Enchanting
At crafting stations (Altars and Anvils), you can craft new items from materials you find in the dungeon. You can also enchant your weapons and armor to give them powerful magical effects.

### üè† The Inn
You may stumble upon a mystical inn, a safe haven where you can rest to restore your health, stash items for later, and talk to quest givers.

### ‚ú® Meta-Progression
At the end of a run, you'll be awarded Soul Shards based on your performance. You can use these shards in the Adventurer's Guild to purchase permanent upgrades that will help you on your next adventures.

### üéµ Sound and Music
The game features a dynamic music system with different tracks for ambient exploration, combat, inns, and vendors.

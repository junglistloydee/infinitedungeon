# The Infinite Dungeon ‚öîÔ∏è

Welcome to The Infinite Dungeon, a feature-rich, command-line rogue-like RPG. Dive into a procedurally generated world where every playthrough is unique. Battle a vast bestiary of monsters, solve clever puzzles, interact with NPCs, complete quests, manage your equipment, and seek legendary artifacts to conquer the dungeon's greatest challenges.

## üéÆ How to Play

Your goal is to become a legend by exploring the dungeon, growing stronger, and ultimately finding a legendary Winning Item. Acquiring such an artifact will summon a powerful guardian you must defeat to truly master the dungeon.

## Core Gameplay

### üß≠ Exploring
The dungeon is an endless series of randomly generated rooms. Each room can contain monsters, items, hazards, NPCs, or puzzles. Pay attention to the descriptions!

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat
When you encounter a monster, combat is turn-based. You can attack, use items, or attempt to run. Defeating monsters grants you Gold and Experience Points (XP).

### üîº Leveling Up
Gaining enough XP will increase your Level, raising your Max HP, Attack Power, and Critical Hit Chance, and fully restoring your health.

### üß© Puzzles
Some rooms contain puzzles like riddles or mechanisms. Solving them can yield valuable rewards or open new paths.

### üìú Quests
You'll find Quest Givers in special Inn rooms or wandering the dungeon. Completing their tasks provides significant rewards in Gold, XP, and unique items.

### ü§ù NPCs
Talk to characters you meet. Some are vendors who will buy and sell goods, while others may offer quests or useful information.

### üéí Equipment
Manage your inventory, equip better weapons, armor, shields, and cloaks to improve your attack and defense. Some items provide permanent stat boosts!

### üíæ Saving
You can save your progress at any time and load it from the main menu.
